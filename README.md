CaravanPi
=====
A Buildroot based caravan system for Raspberry Pi.

This is my Raspberry Pi project intended for caravan use.
This is also my first time with Buildroot so expect problems and bad style etc..
Feel free to suggest ideas, corrections or other stuff that comes in to your mind!

### Features
- Navit-GPS navigation
- GPS logging (see route history)
- Wireless AP (hotspot) using a 4G/LTE usb modem
- Quick dashcam backup system (plug dashcam in, start copying files to a usb drive or upload somewhere)
- ###### (maybe) Simple web browser (chromium based)
- ###### (maybe) OBD dashboard
